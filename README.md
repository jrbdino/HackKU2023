## PROJECT TITLE
Gregory's Great Game

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A HackKU 2023 project to make an endless runner, 2D side-scroller video game.

## HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE PROJECT (GAME)
Our game runs can be run on a standard Python 3.10+ interpreter using the pygame module. pygame can be installed using `pip install pygame`.

## HOW TO USE THE PROJECT (GAME)
Run game_loop.py from the project directory to launch the game.

## Inspiration
We wanted to try to our own spin on an endless runner game like the Google Chrome Dinosaur game.

## What it does
Gregory's Great Game (GGG) is a side-scrolling 2D endless runner game where Gregory the Chicken must avoid the Mini Fox Army and run like the wind.

## How we built it
Our game was made in Python 3.10+ using pygame.  We made our sprites in Aseprite and the backgrounds in Microsoft PowerPoint.  Our primary IDE was JetBrains PyCharm.

## Challenges we ran into
We had to learn pygame over the weekend.  Only one of us knew GitHub and had to teach the rest of us.  We split up the work really well among different people, but combining and implementing multiple people's code took a lot of time away from adding more features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to make a functioning game for the first time.

## What we learned
We learned how to use the pygame module to make a 2D game and learned more about GUI's, framing, and making game logic.  We learned how to use version control in GitHub/GitHub desktop.

## What's next for Gregory's Great Game
We would like to add more enemies and different obstacles to the game.  We want to add scaling difficulty over time.  We also want to make it so if you are holding down the jump button when on the ground, it will let you automatically jump again.  We also want to learn object-oriented programming (OOP) for pygame.

## Technologies Uued
Python 3.10+, pygame, GitHub Desktop, JetBrains PyCharm
